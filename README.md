# Algorithms and Programming Logic course

This repository contains my progress and exercises for the VisualG Logic and Algorithm course taught by Professor Nelio Alves on Udemy.

## About the Course

The VisualG Logic and Algorithm course is a comprehensive introduction to programming logic and algorithms using the VisualG language.

Throughout this course, I will learn the fundamental concepts of programming logic, including variables, data types, control structures, loops, arrays, and more. The course focuses on practical exercises to reinforce the understanding of each topic.

## Progress

I'll be updating this repository regularly to document my progress and showcase my solutions to the course exercises. Feel free to explore the folders and check out my code.
